Model Performance Analysis (CIFAR-10 Classes: Airplane, Automobile, Bird)

Test Accuracy: 80.47%

Class-wise Performance:
- Airplanes: F1-score = 0.7788
- Automobiles: F1-score = 0.8472
- Birds: F1-score = 0.7881

Observations:
1. Automobiles achieved the best performance due to distinctive features (shape, texture)
2. Birds were most challenging with lowest F1-score (0.7881) because of:
   - High intra-class variation (different species)
   - Similar backgrounds to airplanes (sky)
   - Complex textures (feathers vs smooth surfaces)
3. The single hidden layer (128 units) learned useful features but:
   - Struggled with spatial relationships (no convolutional operations)
   - Showed signs of overfitting in later epochs

Improvement Strategies:
- Implement convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction
- Add data augmentation (random flips, rotations)
- Include L2 regularization (Î»=0.001) to reduce overfitting
- Increase model capacity with additional hidden layers
